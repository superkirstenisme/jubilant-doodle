        <blockquote>"Sessions with Akwe were like spending quality time with a critical but impartial friend, who listened deeply and asked difficult questions. It forced me to think about stuff I had not examined, either because my mind was too cluttered, or I was afraid of what I would find. The method of practices, which allows you in between sessions to concentrate on different kinds of issues — both conceptual and practical — was particularly helpful. It allowed me to test new skills and ways of doing things, and either drop them if they did not work or incorporate them into my everyday life if they did."</blockquote>
        <cite>Research Professor, UK</cite>
      </div>

      <div class="t-card">
        <blockquote>"Working with Akwe never felt generic. I really appreciated how she took the time to craft focus practice questions that were clearly tailored to me, and how she would adjust or rethink them if she sensed they might not work well due to my special circumstances. That intentionality made it clear that each session was genuinely bespoke, shaped around the person being coached rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Her style blends reflection with practicality in a way that feels both grounding and gently challenging. The space she creates is calm, thoughtful, and deeply supportive, enabling real clarity and honest exploration."</blockquote>

      <div class="t-card">
        <blockquote>"Having experienced the coaching with Akwe, I can wholeheartedly say that it was a life saver. I was thrust into a Managing Director's position due to unforeseen circumstances but thanks to the coaching I received, I was able to survive. I felt prepared, confident and knew what type of leader I wanted to be. It has been over a year since I completed the coaching and it has easily been one of the best decisions of my life."</blockquote>
        <cite>Managing Director, South Africa</cite>

      <div class="t-card">
        <blockquote>"What I appreciated most about coaching with Akwe was that the work wasn't about fixing me but about widening how I relate to my work and myself. I felt genuinely seen and valued in the process, and over time the practices helped me regain energy and lightness in my work."</blockquote>
